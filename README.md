## Prerequisites

- [Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys) (sign up for free)
- Framwork and tooling needed

**Note:** This project uses strict supply chain security measures. npm and yarn will NOT work. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details.

## Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**

Go to GitHub and [clone the repository](https://github.com/deepgram-starters/[PROJECT-NAME]).

2. **Install dependencies**

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
